# Fuel manage

App to manage the fuel consumption of your vehicle

## Introduction

As a new car owner, and data passionate. I was incredibly curious about my car
consumption data. I was especially curious, besides the amount of money spent on fuel,
 about some potential analyses relevant to kilometers and liters. so, from the first refueling, I started to collect data, such as fuel value, total amount, and kilometers driven.

I started with the development of a graphical user interface to record the collected data in a simpler way and this led to this more complex project, still in progress.
